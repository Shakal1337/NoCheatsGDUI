The first time you start up, you will see a window
The first setup you will have to
specify the paths to the main mods and 
bot replay.
 
to specify the path to the mod 
click on one of the buttons and select
corresponding .json file at me it
looks like this: 
D:\Geometry Dash v2.112\.GDHM\mods\Bypass.json 
and so specify the paths to all .json files.

To specify the path to the replay bot 
press the "Bot" button, set path to bot and 
write the absolute name of the file 
(with extension).
